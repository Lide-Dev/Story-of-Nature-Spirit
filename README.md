# Story-of-Nature-Spirit

**Story of Nature Spirit** is an RPG type game that has a wide world. Created on Godot Engine with GDScript. 

This game tells about a fairy named Raka who was created from the elements of nature. This fairy wants to save the world and the race of fairies from the attack of a dark creature named Radish. Raka will save the world and the race of fairies by balancing the darkness and light in this world.

**Lide Game** is a small team that makes indie games. We are just learning so there are probably a lot of bugs and less features in this game. We apologize about that. We will continue to improve continuously.
